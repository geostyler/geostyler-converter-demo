# geostyler-converter-demo

The converter demo is a simple interface showing two code editors side by side and allowing conversions from one style format (SLD, QML, Mapbox Syle...) to another using Geostyler style parsers.

For a more complete demo of Geostyler's capabilities, see [geostyler/geostyler-demo](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler-demo).
